### Disclaimer

This project was my first time working with Redis Streams and implementing real-time WebSocket in GO!!. I remember that when I used them was in Node :). I feel the current implementation covers the core requirements (message ingestion, queuing, and broadcasting), Iâ€™m aware that the scope and complexity could have been extended further or be even better 

Due to being actively involved in other interview processes, and being super full. I've opted for a clean, functional, and maintainable solution that demonstrates what it was requested without overengineering.

Thanks for your understanding and time reviewing the project!. Regardless I've enjoyed making this
